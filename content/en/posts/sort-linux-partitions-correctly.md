Hi and welcome to my blog!
Here goes a quick tip on how to properly sort partitions number in Linux.

Let's think that we had a disk ```/dev/sda``` with 4 partitions:  

    /dev/sda1
    /dev/sda2
    /dev/sda3
    /dev/sda4

Now, if we have to repartition our disk and delete ```/dev/sda2``` and ```/dev/sda3``` to make ```/dev/sda1``` larger, occasionally you will end up with ```/dev/sda1``` and ```/dev/sda4``` when it should be only ```/dev/sda1``` and ```/dev/sda2```.

To fix this mess and sort the partitions correctly we can use _fdisk_ that is present by default in almost every Linux installation. Remember that _fdisk_ and most of the partition/disk tools are very powerful and can be dangerous. Make sure to have a backup of your important files.

Now, let's do the job.
Begin typing ```sudo fdisk /dev/sda```.

Than type **"m"** to see the help.

Press **"p"** to print the partitions list.

You'll see that they are unsorted.

Now, type **"x"** to access the advanced options.

Than type **"m"** again to see the help.

press **"f"** to fix partitions order.

press **"p"** again to print the partitions list.

Now, they should be sorted correctly ðŸ˜‰.

Press **"w"** to write changes to disk and exit.

It's done.
